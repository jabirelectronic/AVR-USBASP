# USBasp - USB programmer for Atmel AVR controllers
The above programmer is from the website https://www.fischl.de/usbasp/
Modeled and redesigned.
There are some tips about this design:
Internal and external voltage separator section is considered.
A logic 5V output is provided.
A 3.3V output is also provided for low power micros.
And a 500 mA fuse is placed in this circuit to prevent short circuit and damage to the usb port.
The board is designed in two layers.
Be sure to use version 7 of kicad software to view the schematic and PCB map.
